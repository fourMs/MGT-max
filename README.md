# The Musical Gestures Toolbox for Max

This is a collection of tools for analysing and visualising video in realtime. It developed in and for the graphical programming environment Max/MSP/Jitter.

The toolbox is probably most useful for people that already are experienced Max programmers. People looking for similar functionality should check out some of the [standalone applications](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/research/labs/fourms/software/musicalgesturestoolbox/) we have built based on the toolbox.

## History

This was the original [Musical Gestures Toolbox](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/research/labs/fourms/software/musicalgesturestoolbox/). The patches were developed 2004-2007 and haven't been updated since. They should, however, probably still work, although there may be some dependency issues.

Starting from 2006, the patches were embedded within the [Jamoma](http://jamoma.org/) framework. Later there is also a version of MGT for [Matlab](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-matlab) and [Python](https://github.com/fourMs/MGT-python).

The software is currently maintained by the [fourMs lab](https://github.com/fourMs) at [RITMO Centre for Interdisciplinary Studies in Rhythm, Time and Motion](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/) at the University of Oslo.
